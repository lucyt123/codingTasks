## KMeans Clustering
This code uses a KMeans Clustering model to analyse an economics dataset, determining which countries are less economically developed based on various criteria. 

# To run this code, you will need:
pip install sci-kit learm 
pip install pandas 
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn 

When you run the code, you can create a new test data set with various metrics to see what category the country would fall under using the clusters.
